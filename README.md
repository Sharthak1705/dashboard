## ðŸ“¦ Component Decisions

### 1. **Sidebar**

* Provides consistent navigation across the app.
* Keeps dashboard, transactions, and settings accessible.
* Improves usability by giving users a fixed menu.

### 2. **TransactionDetails**

* Displays detailed records of usage (date, GB, spend, status).
* Includes filters, pagination, and search functionality.
* Helps users track their activity clearly.

### 3. **Dashboard**

* Core page that shows summary cards (Active IPs, GB Used, Spend).
* Integrates charts for quick data visualization.
* Serves as the main entry point after login.

### 4. **Form**

* Handles input validation and submission for smaller sections.
* Reusable component for both Login and Register forms.
* Provides error/validation messages.

### 5. **Register**

* Validates input fields for better user experience.
* Connects seamlessly to the login system.

### 6. **Login**

* Entry point for authentication.
* Redirects users to the dashboard after login.
* Uses localStorage for trial
